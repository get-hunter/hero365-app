# Installation Pricing Recommendation for Hero365 Target Users

## Target User Analysis

**Primary Users:** Home service contractors, independent contractors, small-medium HVAC/plumbing/electrical businesses

**Critical Business Needs:**
- Fast phone quotes (< 30 seconds)
- Customer-friendly pricing 
- Competitive rates
- Predictable profit margins
- Simple operations

## 🏆 RECOMMENDED APPROACH: HYBRID MODEL

### 80% Fixed Price (Bread & Butter Jobs)

**Why Fixed Pricing Wins:**
- ✅ **Instant quotes** - "Water heater install is $250"
- ✅ **Customer confidence** - No surprises, clear expectations
- ✅ **Competitive advantage** - Easier to win against hourly competitors
- ✅ **Cash flow predictable** - Contractors know their margins
- ✅ **Operations simple** - No time tracking complexity

**Recommended Fixed Prices:**

| Service | Fixed Price | Typical Time | Hourly Equivalent |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Water Heater Replace | $250 | 3 hours | $83/hour |
| Thermostat Install | $125 | 1.5 hours | $83/hour |
| AC Repair (Standard) | $150 | 2 hours | $75/hour |
| Furnace Filter Change | $50 | 0.5 hours | $100/hour |
| Toilet Install | $200 | 2.5 hours | $80/hour |

### 20% Time-Based (Complex/Unknown Jobs)

**When to Use Hourly:**
- Diagnostic/troubleshooting (unknown scope)
- Custom ductwork modifications
- System design and engineering
- Large commercial projects
- Emergency repairs (overtime rates)

**Recommended Hourly Rates:**
- **Standard**: $95/hour
- **Diagnostic**: $125/hour  
- **Emergency**: $150/hour
- **Specialty/Commercial**: $175/hour

### Why NOT Value-Based Pricing

**Customer Perspective:**
- "30% of equipment cost? That seems random!"
- "Why does installation cost more on expensive equipment?"
- Creates distrust and confusion

**Contractor Perspective:**
- Too complex to calculate quickly
- Hard to explain to customers
- Makes you look expensive upfront

## Implementation in Hero365

### 1. Primary Recommendation: Enhanced Fixed Pricing

```python
# Standard Installation Templates
STANDARD_INSTALLATIONS = {
    "water_heater_replace": {
        "base_price": 250.00,
        "description": "Standard water heater replacement",
        "includes": ["removal", "installation", "basic_hookup"],
        "estimated_hours": 3.0
    },
    "thermostat_install": {
        "base_price": 125.00, 
        "description": "Standard thermostat installation",
        "includes": ["wiring", "programming", "testing"],
        "estimated_hours": 1.5
    }
}

# Smart Adjustments
PRICING_ADJUSTMENTS = {
    "complexity": {
        "simple": 0.9,      # -10% for easy jobs
        "standard": 1.0,    # Base price
        "complex": 1.4      # +40% for difficult access/conditions
    },
    "timing": {
        "business_hours": 1.0,
        "evening": 1.2,
        "weekend": 1.5,
        "emergency": 2.0
    },
    "location": {
        "local": 1.0,       # < 15 miles
        "regional": 1.15,   # 15-30 miles  
        "distant": 1.3      # > 30 miles
    }
}
```

### 2. Customer Communication Templates

**Phone Script for Fixed Pricing:**
```
Customer: "How much to replace my water heater?"
Contractor: "For a standard replacement, installation is $250. That includes removal of the old unit, installation of the new one, and basic hookup. The total with your new water heater would be $[product_price + 250]."
```

**When to Switch to Hourly:**
```
Customer: "I need custom ductwork for my addition"
Contractor: "That's a custom project. My rate is $95/hour and I estimate 6-8 hours based on what you've described. I can give you a firm quote after seeing the space."
```
