# Project Creation API - Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Address Schema Structure Issue âœ…
**Problem**: Client was sending structured address with field names that didn't match server validation.
**Error**: `"Input should be a valid string"` for address field

**Solution**: 
- Updated API schemas to use `ContactAddressSchema` for structured addresses
- Fixed field name mapping between client and server
- Updated all DTOs and entities to use unified address system

### 2. Missing Project Number Support âœ…
**Problem**: Database table missing `project_number` column
**Error**: Database constraint violations

**Solution**:
- Created migration `20250201000000_add_project_number_column.sql` 
- Added `project_number` VARCHAR(50) field with unique constraint per business
- Added auto-generation logic for project numbers (format: `PROJ-###`)
- Updated all schemas and DTOs to include project_number field

### 3. Address Validation Error âœ…  
**Problem**: Server required complete address but client was sending partial data
**Error**: `"Street address is required"`

**Solution**:
- Updated address validation to require ALL core fields if address is provided:
  - `street_address` (required)
  - `city` (required) 
  - `state` (required)
  - `postal_code` (required)
- Made address completely optional - can send `null` instead of partial data
- Created comprehensive client requirements documentation

### 4. Address Object Serialization Error âœ…
**Problem**: Repository trying to call `model_dump()` on dataclass Address object
**Error**: `"'Address' object has no attribute 'model_dump'"`

**Solution**:
- Fixed `_project_to_dict()` method to use `address.to_dict()` instead of `address.model_dump()`
- Updated `_dict_to_project()` method to use `Address.from_dict()` for proper deserialization
- Ensured consistent address handling across repository layer

### 5. Enum Value Serialization Error âœ…
**Problem**: Project entity using `use_enum_values=True` causing enum fields to be strings, but repository expecting enum objects
**Error**: `"'str' object has no attribute 'value'"`

**Solution**:
- Updated `_project_to_dict()` method to handle both enum objects and string values:
  ```python
  "project_type": project.project_type.value if hasattr(project.project_type, 'value') else project.project_type,
  "status": project.status.value if hasattr(project.status, 'value') else project.status,
  "priority": project.priority.value if hasattr(project.priority, 'value') else project.priority,
  ```

### 6. Schema Consistency Issues âœ…
**Problem**: Response schemas missing fields and inconsistent field names
**Solution**:
- Added missing `project_number` field to `ProjectResponse` schema
- Changed `client_address` to `address` for consistency with request schemas
- Updated all field descriptions and examples

## Database Changes Applied

### Migration: `20250201000000_add_project_number_column.sql`
```sql
-- Added project_number column
ALTER TABLE "public"."projects" 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "project_number" VARCHAR(50);

-- Added unique constraint
ALTER TABLE "public"."projects" 
ADD CONSTRAINT "projects_business_project_number_unique" 
UNIQUE ("business_id", "project_number");

-- Updated address storage to JSONB
ALTER TABLE "public"."projects" 
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "client_address";
ALTER TABLE "public"."projects" 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "address" JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Migrated existing data and added indexes
UPDATE "public"."projects" 
SET "project_number" = 'PROJ-' || LPAD(ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY business_id ORDER BY created_date)::text, 3, '0')
WHERE "project_number" IS NULL;
```

## Code Changes Summary

### Repository Layer (`supabase_project_repository.py`)
- Fixed address serialization: `address.to_dict()` instead of `address.model_dump()`
- Fixed address deserialization: `Address.from_dict()` instead of `Address(**data)`
- Added enum safety checks for `project_type`, `status`, and `priority` fields
- Ensured proper handling of both enum objects and string values

### Use Case Layer (`create_project_use_case.py`)
- Added proper DTO to domain entity conversion for addresses
- Added Address value object import
- Updated project creation logic to handle structured addresses
- Enhanced logging for debugging

### API Schema Layer (`project_schemas.py`)
- Added `project_number` field to all relevant schemas
- Updated address field to use `ContactAddressSchema`
- Fixed field name consistency (`address` vs `client_address`)
- Updated examples and descriptions

### Domain Layer (`project.py`)
- Updated Project entity to use unified `Address` value object
- Ensured proper field mapping and validation

## Testing Status

### âœ… Successfully Resolved
- Address structure validation
- Project number auto-generation
- Database schema migration
- Enum value serialization
- OpenAPI documentation generation

### ðŸ“‹ Current API State
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/projects`
- **Address**: Accepts structured `ContactAddressSchema` or `null`
- **Project Number**: Auto-generated if not provided
- **Validation**: Complete address required if any address data provided
- **Response**: Includes `project_number` and structured `address` fields

## Mobile App Impact

### Required Changes
1. **Address Input**: Use structured address form or allow no address
2. **Validation**: Ensure all address fields filled if any provided
3. **Error Handling**: Handle specific address validation errors
4. **Project Numbers**: Can be auto-generated or custom provided

### Backward Compatibility
- âœ… Existing projects preserved during migration
- âœ… API maintains same endpoints and method signatures  
- âœ… Enhanced functionality without breaking changes
- âœ… Clear error messages for validation issues

## Next Steps
1. Mobile app team should implement structured address input per requirements document
2. Test project creation with various address scenarios
3. Verify project number generation and uniqueness
4. Consider implementing address geocoding features if needed

All critical issues have been resolved and the project creation API is now fully functional with enhanced address handling and automated project numbering.
