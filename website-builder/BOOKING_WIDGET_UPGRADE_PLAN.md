# Booking Widget UX Upgrade - Implementation Plan

## Goal
Upgrade the booking widget UX to a guided, highâ€‘conversion wizard inspired by professional service booking flows, while staying on our design system. Add a service-area gate (ZIP/postal pre-check) and backend endpoints for professionals to manage supported ZIPs.

## Outcomes
- Higher conversion via step-by-step flow with clear progress and fewer fields per step
- Service-area validation before booking flow starts
- Robust APIs to manage supported postal codes and validate availability
- Mobile-first, fullscreen wizard; centered modal on desktop; close on backdrop/X; scrollable content

## User Flow (Wizard)

### 0) Gate: ZIP/Postal pre-check
- Asks ZIP/postal (with country picker defaulted from GeoIP), CTA: "Continue"
- Validates support; if unsupported: offer alternatives (call, leave details, request service notification)
- Stores normalized location (city, state/region, timezone)

### 1) Need/Category
- "What do you need?" grid (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, etc.), then sub-services (BookableService)
- If the ZIP is unsupported for the chosen category, show guidance and capture lead

### 2) Address
- Autocomplete (Places if configured), or manual fields; validate inside service area
- Pre-fill city/state/timezone from step 0
- Optional notes about access, pets, parking

### 3) Date & Time
- Tabs: First Available | All Appointments
- Shows time slots from Availability API filtered by ZIP/timezone & service duration
- Handles "ASAP / Emergency" fast-path

### 4) Contact & Consent
- First/Last name, phone (E.164), email
- SMS consent checkbox (logged), marketing opt-in optional

### 5) Details & Attachments
- Free text problem description, optional photos/videos upload

### 6) Review & Confirm
- Summary card (location, service, time slot, contact, dispatch fee if any)
- Accept ToS checkbox; Confirm

### 7) Confirmation
- Success screen; Add to calendar; share link; "Call us" fallback

### Unsupported ZIP path
- Displays "Not yet in your area" + lead form; creates AvailabilityRequest lead

## UI Components (new/updated)
- StepperHeader (icons + titles; sticky on mobile)
- ZipGate (step 0)
- ServiceCategoryPicker + SubServicePicker (step 1)
- AddressForm (step 2)
- SlotPicker (step 3) with "First Available" and calendar view
- ContactForm with SMS Consent (step 4)
- DetailsUpload (step 5)
- ReviewCard + ConfirmBar (step 6)
- ResultScreen (step 7)
- StickyFooterActions on mobile (Next/Back primary/secondary)
- Accessibility: focus trap, ESC to close, tab order, ARIA roles

## State & Architecture
- BookingWizardContext (single source of truth)
  - zipInfo: {postalCode, countryCode, city, region, timezone, supported}
  - categoryId, serviceId
  - address: {line1, line2, city, region, postalCode, countryCode, geo}
  - slot: {start, end, timezone}
  - contact: {firstName, lastName, phoneE164, email, smsConsent}
  - details: {notes, attachments[]}
  - dispatchFeeAccepted: boolean
- Finite steps: zip â†’ category â†’ address â†’ slot â†’ contact â†’ details â†’ review â†’ done
- Guard transitions (can't proceed until each step valid)

## Backend: Data Model (Supabase)

### Tables (new)
- **service_areas**
  - id UUID pk; business_id UUID fk; postal_code text; country_code text(2); city text; region text; timezone text; polygon geography (nullable); is_active boolean default true; created_at; updated_at
  - unique (business_id, postal_code, country_code)
  - index on (business_id, is_active, postal_code)

- **availability_requests** (for unsupported ZIP leads)
  - id UUID pk; business_id; contact_name; phone_e164; email; postal_code; country_code; notes; created_at

### Adjustments (existing)
- bookable_services: ensure category field and min/max duration present
- availability endpoints accept postal_code + timezone

## APIs (FastAPI, Pydantic)

### Public
- `GET /api/v1/public/service-areas/check?business_id=&postal_code=&country=US`
  - Response: {supported, normalized:{city,region,timezone,postal_code,country}, suggestions?:[{postal_code, distance_km}], message?}

- `POST /api/v1/public/availability/slots`
  - Body: {business_id, service_id, postal_code, country, timezone, date_range:{from,to}}
  - Response: {slots:[{start,end,capacity}], first_available?:{start,end}}

- `POST /api/v1/public/availability/request`
  - Body: {business_id, contact:{name,phone_e164,email}, postal_code, country, notes?}
  - Response: {created:true, id}

### Professional (auth required)
- `GET /api/v1/pro/service-areas?business_id=&q=&limit=&offset=`
- `POST /api/v1/pro/service-areas/bulk-upsert`
  - Body: {business_id, areas:[{postal_code,country,city?,region?,timezone?,is_active?}]}
- `DELETE /api/v1/pro/service-areas/{id}`
- `POST /api/v1/pro/service-areas/import` (CSV upload)
- `GET /api/v1/pro/service-areas/export.csv`

### Validation
- Normalize ZIP + country; resolve city/region/timezone
- Enforce unique (business_id, postal_code, country)
- RLS: owners of business_id

## Migration (DDL)
- Create table service_areas with columns above; unique and indexes
- Create table availability_requests; index by business_id, created_at
- Grant to anon only for public read check endpoint via RPC wrapper or secure view
- RLS policies for pro endpoints

## Widget â†” API Integration
- Step 0: call service-areas/check; store normalized; block proceed if !supported â†’ offer request endpoint
- Step 3: call availability/slots with postal_code/timezone; show "First Available"
- Review: include dispatch fee policy text (configurable per business if present)
- Confirmation: existing bookings API; include postal_code + timezone

## Error/Edge Handling
- Unknown postal code: allow manual city/region entry; compute timezone from region fallback
- Multi-country: always include country param; default from GeoIP
- Daylight saving: respect timezone from service_areas
- Emergency services bypass slot picker â†’ route to phone or special queue

## Analytics
- Track step events (view, next, back, abandon)
- Record unsupported ZIP leads

## Mobile UX
- Fullscreen step wizard; sticky bottom action bar; large tap targets
- Progress header collapses on scroll; back gesture support

## Security & Privacy
- Validate/escape uploaded files; limit size/types
- Rate-limit ZIP check and availability
- PII storage encrypted at rest; SMS consent logged

## Deliverables & Order

### 1) DB + APIs
- Supabase migration: service_areas, availability_requests
- Implement FastAPI endpoints with Pydantic models + tests
- RLS policies; index/perf
- Run /scripts/generate-client.sh (OpenAPI, TS client)

### 2) Widget UX
- New stepper and steps (ZipGate â†’ Done) with context
- Integrate endpoints: check, slots, request
- Accessibility, ESC/backdrop/X close; keyboard flow
- QA mobile/desktop; cross-browser

### 3) Docs
- docs/api/booking-widget-flow.md (steps, payloads, examples)
- docs/api/service-areas.md (ZIP management APIs)
- Update ELITE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Phase 3: "Service-area gate & availability UX"

## Acceptance Criteria
- Can't proceed without supported ZIP (unless emergency path)
- Time slots adjust to ZIP/timezone
- Unsupported ZIP path stores lead via API
- Professional can bulk manage ZIPs via API (and CSV import)
