# Supabase Service Refactoring

## Overview

The monolithic `backend/app/core/supabase.py` file has been refactored to follow clean architecture principles. This document outlines the changes made and the new structure.

## Problems with the Original Implementation

1. **Single Responsibility Violation**: One class handling 8+ different concerns
2. **Mixed Layers**: Infrastructure code sitting in the `core/` directory  
3. **Monolithic Design**: 229 lines of tightly coupled functionality
4. **Duplicate Implementation**: Redundant with existing clean architecture components

## New Architecture

### Components Created

1. **Enhanced `SupabaseAuthAdapter`** (`backend/app/infrastructure/external_services/supabase_auth_adapter.py`)
   - Moved all authentication logic to proper infrastructure layer
   - Added OAuth methods (`sign_in_with_oauth`, `create_user_with_oauth`)
   - Added OTP methods (`send_otp`, `verify_otp`)
   - Added user metadata management (`update_user_metadata`)

2. **Created `ManageOnboardingUseCase`** (`backend/app/application/use_cases/user/manage_onboarding.py`)
   - Dedicated use case for onboarding business logic
   - Methods: `mark_onboarding_completed`, `get_onboarding_data`, `update_onboarding_step`
   - Properly separated business logic from infrastructure

3. **Added `AuthFacade`** (`backend/app/core/auth_facade.py`)
   - Clean facade that delegates to proper components
   - Maintains backward compatibility during transition
   - Provides simplified interface while preserving clean architecture

4. **Updated Dependency Injection** (`backend/app/infrastructure/config/dependency_injection.py`)
   - Added `ManageOnboardingUseCase` to container
   - Proper wiring of all components

## Migration Summary

### Files Updated

- `backend/app/api/deps.py` - Updated to use `auth_facade`
- `backend/app/core/security.py` - Updated token verification methods
- `backend/app/api/controllers/oauth_controller.py` - Migrated to use auth facade and clean architecture
- `backend/app/api/routes/auth.py` - Updated all auth endpoints to use proper services
- `backend/app/api/routes/users.py` - Updated user management endpoints
- `backend/app/core/db.py` - Removed monolithic service dependency

### Original Functionality Preserved

All original functionality has been preserved while improving the architecture:

- ✅ Token verification
- ✅ User creation (email/phone)
- ✅ OTP handling
- ✅ User metadata management  
- ✅ Onboarding logic
- ✅ User deletion and listing
- ✅ OAuth authentication (Apple/Google)

## Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
2. **Proper Layer Separation**: Infrastructure, Application, and Domain layers respected
3. **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to one concern don't affect others
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new authentication providers or onboarding steps

## Migration Path

The refactoring was done incrementally:

1. Created new clean architecture components
2. Updated all imports to use `auth_facade`
3. Made all dependent functions async where needed
4. Updated data access patterns for new structure
5. Removed monolithic `supabase.py` file

## Next Steps

1. Remove the `auth_facade` and migrate directly to use cases and services
2. Add comprehensive unit tests for new components
3. Update any remaining legacy code that might use old patterns
4. Consider adding more authentication providers through the clean architecture

## Code Quality Improvements

- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules no longer depend on low-level modules
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients only depend on interfaces they use
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Easy to extend with new functionality without modifying existing code
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Authentication, business logic, and data access are clearly separated

This refactoring transforms the codebase from a monolithic approach to a properly layered, maintainable architecture that follows SOLID principles.
