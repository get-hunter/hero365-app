-- =============================================
-- 2. FIX VIEW DEPENDENCIES
-- =============================================

-- Drop and recreate v_business_profile without legacy column dependencies
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_business_profile;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_business_profile AS
SELECT 
    -- Core business fields (explicitly listed to avoid legacy columns)
    b.id,
    b.owner_id,
    b.name,
    b.display_name,
    b.email,
    b.phone,
    b.phone_country_code,
    b.phone_display,
    b.website,
    b.address,
    b.city,
    b.state,
    b.postal_code,
    b.country,
    b.timezone,
    b.business_type,
    b.company_size,

    b.years_in_business,
    b.year_established,

    b.insurance_number,
    b.certifications,
    b.service_radius,
    b.emergency_available,
    b.business_hours,
    b.is_active,
    b.is_verified,
    b.onboarding_completed,
    b.referral_source,
    b.created_date,

    pt.slug as primary_trade_slug,

FROM businesses b
LEFT JOIN business_trades bt ON bt.business_id = b.id AND bt.is_primary = TRUE
LEFT JOIN trades pt ON bt.trade_id = pt.id;

-- =============================================
-- 3. REMOVE LEGACY COLUMNS
-- =============================================

-- Now safe to drop legacy columns
ALTER TABLE businesses 
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS selected_activity_slugs,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS residential_services,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS commercial_services,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS selected_residential_service_keys,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS selected_commercial_service_keys;

-- =============================================
-- 4. REMOVE LEGACY INDEXES
-- =============================================

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_businesses_selected_activity_slugs;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_businesses_residential_services;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_businesses_commercial_services;

-- =============================================
-- 5. CREATE COMPATIBILITY VIEWS
-- =============================================

-- Create a compatibility view that mimics the old selected_activity_slugs column
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_business_activities_compat AS
SELECT 
    b.id as business_id,
    b.name as business_name,
    COALESCE(
        array_agg(bas.activity_slug ORDER BY bas.display_order) 
        FILTER (WHERE bas.activity_slug IS NOT NULL), 
        '{}'::text[]
    ) as selected_activity_slugs,
    COUNT(bas.id) as activity_count
FROM businesses b
LEFT JOIN business_activity_selections bas ON bas.business_id = b.id AND bas.is_active = TRUE
GROUP BY b.id, b.name;

-- =============================================
-- 6. ADD DOCUMENTATION
-- =============================================

COMMENT ON VIEW v_business_profile IS 'Business profile view with derived primary trade information from normalized business_trades table. Excludes legacy activity and service columns.';
COMMENT ON VIEW v_business_activities_compat IS 'Compatibility view that provides selected_activity_slugs array for backward compatibility with legacy code.';
COMMENT ON TABLE businesses IS 'Core business entity. Trade relationships managed via business_trades table. Activity selections managed via business_activity_selections table.';

-- Add comments to helper functions
COMMENT ON FUNCTION get_business_activity_slugs(UUID) IS 'Returns active activity slugs for a business - replacement for businesses.selected_activity_slugs column';
COMMENT ON FUNCTION add_business_activity(UUID, TEXT, INTEGER) IS 'Add an activity to a business - replacement for array manipulation on selected_activity_slugs';
COMMENT ON FUNCTION remove_business_activity(UUID, TEXT) IS 'Remove an activity from a business - replacement for array manipulation on selected_activity_slugs';
